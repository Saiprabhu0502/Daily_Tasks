        <em>Kohli was averaging 106 in the last 5 chases in T20’s before this match. And today, after an injured Yuvraj laboured to 21 and was dismissed by Faulkner in the 14th over in this Ind vs Aus World T20 encounter, it was over to captain (Dhoni) and vice-captain. With 39 required off 18 deliveries, it seemed like a hairy end approaching. The next 13 balls read 4 4 6 2 1 2   0 4 4 4 0 4   4. Dhoni played only 2 of these and scored 6 including the winning boundary. Kohli sunk to the ground as the ball crossed the boundary – a departure from the usual punch in the air and raised bat celebration – testifying how this chase had tested his temperament, still he managed to come out on top.
