           <i> Kohli started a series of records with being the third batsman in the world scoring 1000 ODI runs before turning 22. In 2013, Kohli became the captain of the Indian cricket team for the triangular series in West Indies after Dhoni was injured and found unfit to play. In the second match of the tournament, Kohli scored his first hundred as a captain scoring 102 off 83 balls. In the seven-match ODI series against Australia, Kohli hit the third fastest ODI century, crossing the 100 run mark in 61 balls. In the two-match Test series against West Indies, which is memorable as the last Test series of Tendulkar, Kohli equaled Viv Richard’s record of being the fastest batsman to get 5000 runs in ODI.

          <i>  Virat Kohli has attributed his success to his coach Rajkumar Sharma and the guidance he received from former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi. Such an unbelievable feat of success has not been able to sweep Kohli off the grounds. He remains a very humble person, a true role model for youths of India. Recently, he has been rated 8th in ESPN’s top 10 most popular sportsmen in the world being preceded by sportsmen like Christiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Roger Federer etc. And this is where he belongs.
